The adult Asperger self-help revolution is on! We meet to share experiences, support each other, find resources, interact in a safe environment, network with fellow Aspies, and take responsibility for our growth. One aim of this group is to connect people who are in the early stages of their AS realization journeys with those who have known they had AS for much of their lives. We have a lot to learn from each other about how to thrive in wider society as well as how to live in less conventional ways that are attuned to our uniqueness.
